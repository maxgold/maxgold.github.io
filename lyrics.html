<h1> The Sea and the Rhythm </h1>

<h2> Iron & Wine </h2>

<p>Tonight we're the sea and the salty breeze  

<br> The milk from your breast is on my lips  

<br> And lovelier words from your mouth to me  

<br> When salty my sweat and fingertips </p> 

<p>Our hands they seek the end of afternoons  

<br> My hands believe and move over you </p>

<p>Tonight, we're the sea and the rhythm there  

<br> The waves and the wind and night is black  

<br> Tonight we're the scent of your long black hair  

<br> Spread out like your breath across my back </p> 

<p>Your hands they move like waves over me  

<br> Beneath the moon, tonight, we're the sea</p>
